# LoRa_Tracker
## Description:
This device aims to be a GPS tracker which connects over LoRa to the [Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), which then in turns makes the GPS position available to the internet. The PCB roughly has the footprint of a 18650 Lithium-ion rechargable cell, which is widely used and available.

## Progress so far:
- PCB design done
- PCB design verified (first prototype assembled)
